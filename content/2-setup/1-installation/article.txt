Installing {{kirbybook}} is really easy. Since it has been crafted on top of Kirby CMS it doesn't need any sort of database setup at all. Just copy the files to your server and you're good to go.

1. Unzip the downloaded theme files package.
2. Upload everything to your server (make sure to include the invisible `.htaccess` file).
3. Point your browser to `http://yournewsite.com/panel` and use the included installer to create your first user account.

This is really all it takes to get up and running with a basic {{kirbybook}} powered publication.

> **Please remember** that Kirby CMS is not free. If you use this theme on a public website, don't forget to (link: http://getkirby.com/buy text: buy a license) for Kirby (currently from â‚¬15,- / $17,-).
