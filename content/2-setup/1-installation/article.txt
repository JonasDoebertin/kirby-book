Installing {{kirbybook}} is really easy!

1. Unzip the downloaded theme files package
2. Upload everything to your server (make sure to upload the invisible `.htaccess` file, too)
3. Point your browser to `http://yournewsite.com/panel` and use the included installer to create your first user account

This is really all it takes to get up and running with a basic {{kirbybook}} powered publication.
