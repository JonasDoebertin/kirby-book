Footer Text
    :The sites footer text is displayed within the navigation sidebar right below the chapter/article overview. It is perfect for adding a copyright message or something similar and supports standard markdown features.

## Webmaster Tools

Adding your site to Googles or Bings *Webmaster Tools* requires you to add a little authentication key to your pages markup. With {{kirbybook}}, instead of manually adding them to the templates, you can simply add these keys here and {{kirbybook}} will take care of the rest for you.
