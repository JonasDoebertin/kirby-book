{{kirbybook}} lets you publish your book in any language you want.

## Setting the content language

If you choose to publish your book in a language other then English, you should visit your *Site Options* and set the *Content Language* setting accordingly. This will a) tell search engines what language your book is published in and b) tell {{kirbybook}} to load the theme translation (button/icon hints, Dashboard links, etc.) in the same language (if available).

{{kirbybook}} currently includes theme translations for the following languages:

* English
* German

## Translating the Theme

If you want to use {{kirbybook}} with a content language that's not included in the above list you may add the theme translation yourself. Otherwise, {{kirbybook}} will just fallback to English texts.

To add a theme translation you have to create a new translation file for your language. Don't worry, this is really easy:

1. Find the default translation file `site/languages/en.php`
2. Copy and rename it to your desired languages ID (eg. `de.php` or `fr.php`)
3. Open the newly created file in a text editor of your choice and translate all the texts.
