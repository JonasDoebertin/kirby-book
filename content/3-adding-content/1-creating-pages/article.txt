Your {{kirbybook}} powered publication consists of a variety of pages made up of chapters and articles.

## Chapters & Articles

Generally, chapters and articles are very similar. In fact, both page types allow you to add the same type of page content with exactely the same Markdown and Kirbytext support. The only difference is that a chapter may contain any number of articles while articles can't contain any other articles. This allows for a better content breakdown and helps you define the left hand menu.

Of course you may create standalone articles that are not added to a chapter and live on their own.

## Creating a New Page

To create a new page navigate to your site Dashboard. If you want to add a new root level page, simply click the *Add* button in the *Pages* section.

If you want to add an article to an existing chapter, first click the chapters name to change to its dedicated Dashboard page. Then, from the *Pages* section in the sidebar choose *Add*.

After clicking the *Add* button, a modal window will pop up asking you for the new pages name, its *URL-appendix* and a template. Enter a name, maybe modify the autogenerated appendix and choose a template (in some situations there may be only one option to choose from).
