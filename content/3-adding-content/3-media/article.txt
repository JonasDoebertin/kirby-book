Embedding various media objects like Youtube videos, Instagram pictures, Vines or Tweets is as easy as it could possibly be. The reason for this is a custom Kirbytext Tag (similar to a WordPress Shortcode or BBCode) that {{kirbybook}} provides out of the box.

To add one of the various supported media objects to your page, all you need to do is to use the `(embed)` Kirbytext tag and add the url of the object you would like to embed to it.

Here are some highlights of the long list of sites you can embed from ((link: http://embed.ly/providers text: full list)):

To make using oEmbed as painless as possible, {{kirbybook}} heavily relys on a service called (link: http://embed.ly/cards text: Embedly Cards). It takes your media urls and generates the beautiful and responsive embeds you like so much asynchronously (without affecting page load times).

 ## Options
 
 When using the`(embed)` Kirbytext tag, there is a small set of options you can use to customize the display of the embedded images/videos/articles.
