Headline: Embedding Media

Text: 

Embedding various media objects like Youtube videos, Instagram pictures, Vines or Tweets is as easy as it could possibly be. The reason for this is a custom Kirbytext Tag (similar to a Shortcode or BBCodes) that {{kirbybook}} provides out of the box.

To add one of the various supported media objects to your page, all you need to do is to use the `(embed)` Kirbytext Tag and add the url of the object you would like to embed to it.

To get an impression of what sites or supported, please have a look at the following list of embeddable objects:

* GitHub Gists
* Instagram
* Kickstarter
* Soundcloud
* Spotify
* Twitter
* Vimeo
* Vine
* Youtube
