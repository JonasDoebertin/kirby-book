## Where to get it?

{{kirbybook}} is available for purchase right from this website (just click that big'ol *Buy now!* button above). Payments are handled nice and securely via (link: https://gum.co/kirbybook text: Gumroad). They'll also take care of delivering all future updates right to your inbox so you'll never miss out on any new features.

## What is included?

When it comes to purchasing {{kirbybook}}, you'll get to choose between two versions:

1. A **standard ready-to-use edition** that you can upload to your webhost without any further ado.
2. A **developer edition** for advanced users which includes all source files for esier customization.

Each license you purchase is **valid for a single website** (of course you may create as many local development/testing installations as you like). If you want to use {{kirbybook}} on multiple websites or domains, you may choose the number of licenses you need during the checkout process. If you need a lot of licenses (6 or more) drop me a message at (email: user@example.com text: support@jd-powered.net) to talk about and arrange volume discounts.

* all uncompressed and well-documented JavaScript and Sass source files
* Composer, Bower and Npm package files to install all vendor assets required for development

* Additional configuration files that enable you to use a complete Git-based workflow, including `.gitignore` and `.gitmodules`.
