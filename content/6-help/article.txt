## FAQ

#### Broken subpages

Visiting your home (or "Introduction") page works great, but trying to visit any subpage shows a blank page or even leads to a server error? Please make sure that you:

1. Included the (hidden) `.htaccess` file when uploading / moving the {{kirbybook}} files
2. Updated your RewriteBase setting according to your setup.

If you're running {{kirbybook}} at the root of your domain try enabling the RewriteBase in your `.htaccess` file like so:

```
RewriteBase /
````

If you're running {{kirbybook}} in a subfolder, make sure to set the RewriteBase according to the name of your subfolder:

```
RewriteBase /my-subfolder
```

#### Broken content after saving

If your site displays the initial demo content just fine but breaks as soon as you try to save your own content changes or your content files (within the `/content` directory) look broken this might be an issue with a missing PHP extension.

To handle text correctly, {{kirbybook}} uses the `mbstring` extension. While this comes preinstalled with 99% of hosting providers there might be situations where this is missing. Try contacting your hosting provider and kindly ask them to enable that essential extension for you.
