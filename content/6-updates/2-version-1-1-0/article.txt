The updated version 1.1.0 adds the new **»Download as ePub«** feature, upgrades {{kirbybook}} to Kirby CMS 2.2 and contains various small fixes.

#### Highlights

* **ePub download:** Let your readers download a copy of your publication in the well-proven ePub format by simply enabling a checkbox in the site options. Everything will be handled for you.
* **Faster browsing experience:** With the help of a little PJAX magic browsing a publication powered by {{kirbybook}} is faster then ever before.
* **Improved media embedding:** A new and improved way of adding mutimedia objects like Vimeo and YouTube videos, tweets, vines, etc. to your content makes this feature a lot quicker and more powerful.
* **Kirby 2.2:** Take advantage of the new features (link: http://getkirby.com/changelog/kirby-2-2-0 text: Kirby 2.2) brings. This includes the completly rewritten Panel which makes managing your content even more easy.

#### Additional changes and bugfixes

* Choose to exclude the *Introduction* page from the chapter/article numbering
* Use keyboard arrows to navigate between pages
* Optimized gulp task structure and javascript compiling workflow

## Updating

1. Make a backup of your old `/content` directory.
2. Replace all old files and folders (except your `/content` directory) with the new ones from the download.
3. From the Panel:
    1. Update your »Site Options« by filling in the new »ePub Metadata« section.
    2. Walk through all your chapters/articles and resave them.
